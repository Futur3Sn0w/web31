## Faithful Windows 3.1 recreation in HTML+JS
This is a pixel-for-pixel recreation of Windows 3.11- it's design and functionality- recreated using web technologies. By using real Windows assets, and carefully inspecting hundreds of sample screenshots and real Windows emulators, I've created what I hope is a faithful representation of using Windows 3.11.

## Inspiration
Back in the early 2000s and into the early 2010s, there was a site that recreated Windows 3.1 using web technology, and in a damn good way. The functionality was nearly spot-on, and it always filled me with joy and wonder to see such a no-barriers way to experience retro Windows.
